			<h2>Ford to bring 10,000 pounds of fresh food to Southwest Detroit residents with autonomous vehicle delivery pilot</h2>
			<p class="description">Ford is launching an autonomous fresh food delivery pilot, which is expected to bring 10,000 pounds of fresh food to the doorsteps of mobility challenged senior citizens in need in Southwest Detroit.</p>
			<p>The service uses a low-speed autonomous shuttle upfitted for food delivery running along a fixed route in the Michigan Central impact area, where Ford is researching mobility innovation.</p>
			<p>A local art student created an exterior design for the shuttle that reflects the diversity of the Southwest Detroit neighborhood and a message of community.</p>
			<p>Ford Fund and Gleaners have distributed 2.4 million pounds of food through the delivery program and Ford Resource and Engagement Centers.</p>
			<p>Participants currently receive a mix of dry and canned goods plus fresh produce, including milk and cheese.</p>
			<p>Now, Rio Vista residents will receive another delivery each month containing additional fresh produce and milk.</p>
            <p>The items were determined based on feedback from residents who are already participating, and will be reevaluated throughout the pilot.</p>
