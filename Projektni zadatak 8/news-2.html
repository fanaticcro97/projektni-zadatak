			<h2>2022 next gen Mustang poised to help drive nascar cup series</h2>
			<p class="description">A completely new era in stock car racing is ushered in today as Ford unveils its all-new 2022 NASCAR Next Gen Mustang to the public in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
			<p>The Next Gen Mustang will compete in the NASCAR Cup Series starting next season.</p>
			<p>The new car, which has been under development for two years, is completely different from its predecessor – redesigned from the ground up. </p>
			<p>Unlike past versions, with the exterior being the only noticeable change, this model is built for the future, featuring flexibility for technological advances such as a hybrid or electric powertrain.</p>
			<p>The new race car more closely mirrors its Mustang production counterpart, which maintains its title as world’s best-selling sports car.</p>
			<p>Changes include rack-and-pinion steering, independent rear suspension and 18-inch tires with aluminum forged wheels.</p>
